This is an NVDA addon in development that alerts the user via sound effect or TTS message when an element is not visible on the screen. This will make testing for screen reader testers much easier and faster. It looks for things like opacity <= 1, z values, and currently all I can think of that SR will pickup but not be visible on a page.

Current Issues:

Can't get the dang thing to package to NVDA.
